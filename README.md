#### Visitors Goals

The main goal for any visitor would be to enjoy a challenging game of Battleship against the computer and test their strategic skills.
Another goal is to compete with friends or family members to determine who can sink the computer's ships most efficiently.
To spend some leisure time with an engaging and interactive game.
Divided into different categories, the visitor's goals may look like this:

#### First-Time Visitor Goals
- I want to experience a game of Battleship against the computer.
- I want to have fun and test my strategic thinking.
- I want to explore the game and learn how to play.
- I want to see what the game has to offer and how challenging it is.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
- I want to improve my gameplay and try different strategies.
- I want to beat my previous high score and achieve better results.
- I want to challenge my friends to see who can defeat the computer's fleet more efficiently.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals
- I want to compete with my friends to see who's the best or fastest.
- I want to see if there are any new challenges or game modes added to enhance my experience from time to time.
